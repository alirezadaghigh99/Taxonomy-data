=============================== warnings summary ===============================

  /local/data0/moved_data/publishablew/cleanlab/cleanlab/cleanlab/object_detection/summary.py:433: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(frameon=False, figsize=figsize)
