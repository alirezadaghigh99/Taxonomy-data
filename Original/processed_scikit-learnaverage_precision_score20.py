def average_precision_score(
    y_true, y_score, *, average="macro", pos_label=1, sample_weight=None
):
    """Compute average precision (AP) from prediction scores.

    AP summarizes a precision-recall curve as the weighted mean of precisions
    achieved at each threshold, with the increase in recall from the previous
    threshold used as the weight:

    .. math::
        \\text{AP} = \\sum_n (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n` and :math:`R_n` are the precision and recall at the nth
    threshold [1]_. This implementation is not interpolated and is different
    from computing the area under the precision-recall curve with the
    trapezoidal rule, which uses linear interpolation and can be too
    optimistic.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <precision_recall_f_measure_metrics>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        True binary labels or binary label indicators.

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by :term:`decision_function` on some classifiers).

    average : {'micro', 'samples', 'weighted', 'macro'} or None, \
            default='macro'
        If ``None``, the scores for each class are returned. Otherwise,
        this determines the type of averaging performed on the data:

        ``'micro'``:
            Calculate metrics globally by considering each element of the label
            indicator matrix as a label.
        ``'macro'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted
            mean.  This does not take label imbalance into account.
        ``'weighted'``:
            Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted
            by support (the number of true instances for each label).
        ``'samples'``:
            Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average.

        Will be ignored when ``y_true`` is binary.

    pos_label : int, float, bool or str, default=1
        The label of the positive class. Only applied to binary ``y_true``.
        For multilabel-indicator ``y_true``, ``pos_label`` is fixed to 1.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    average_precision : float
        Average precision score.

    See Also
    --------
    roc_auc_score : Compute the area under the ROC curve.
    precision_recall_curve : Compute precision-recall pairs for different
        probability thresholds.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionchanged:: 0.19
      Instead of linearly interpolating between operating points, precisions
      are weighted by the change in recall since the last operating point.
