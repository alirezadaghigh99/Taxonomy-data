    """Calculate the KNN graph from the features if it is not provided in the kwargs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features :
        The input feature array, with shape (N, M), where N is the number of samples and M is the number of features.
    n_neighbors :
        The number of nearest neighbors to consider. If None, a default value is determined based on the feature array size.
    metric :
        The distance metric to use for computing distances between points. If None, the metric is determined based on the feature array shape.
    correct_exact_duplicates :
        Whether to correct the KNN graph to ensure that exact duplicates have zero mutual distance, and they are correctly included in the KNN graph.
    **sklearn_knn_kwargs :
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the search index constructor.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError :
        If `features` is None, as it's required to construct a KNN graph from scratch.

    Returns
    -------
    knn_graph :
        A sparse, weighted adjacency matrix representing the KNN graph of the feature array.
    knn :
        A k-nearest neighbors search object fitted to the input feature array. This object can be used to query the nearest neighbors of new data points.
