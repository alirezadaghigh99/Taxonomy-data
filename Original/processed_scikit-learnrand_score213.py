def rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred):
    """Rand index.

    The Rand Index computes a similarity measure between two clusterings
    by considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are
    assigned in the same or different clusters in the predicted and
    true clusterings [1]_ [2]_.

    The raw RI score [3]_ is:

    .. code-block:: text

        RI = (number of agreeing pairs) / (number of pairs)

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <rand_score>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,), dtype=integral
        Ground truth class labels to be used as a reference.

    labels_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,), dtype=integral
        Cluster labels to evaluate.

    Returns
    -------
    RI : float
       Similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, 1.0 stands for
       perfect match.

    Examples
    --------
    Perfectly matching labelings have a score of 1 even

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import rand_score
      >>> rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters
    are complete but may not always be pure, hence penalized:

      >>> rand_score([0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      np.float64(0.83...)
