    """
    Convert a batch of logarithmic representations of SE(3) matrices `log_transform`
    to a batch of 4x4 SE(3) matrices using the exponential map.
    See e.g. [1], Sec 9.4.2. for more detailed description.

    A SE(3) matrix has the following form:
        ```
        [ R 0 ]
        [ T 1 ] ,
        ```
    where `R` is a 3x3 rotation matrix and `T` is a 3-D translation vector.
    SE(3) matrices are commonly used to represent rigid motions or camera extrinsics.

    In the SE(3) logarithmic representation SE(3) matrices are
    represented as 6-dimensional vectors `[log_translation | log_rotation]`,
    i.e. a concatenation of two 3D vectors `log_translation` and `log_rotation`.

    The conversion from the 6D representation to a 4x4 SE(3) matrix `transform`
    is done as follows:
        ```
        transform = exp( [ hat(log_rotation) 0 ]
                         [   log_translation 1 ] ) ,
        ```
    where `exp` is the matrix exponential and `hat` is the Hat operator [2].

    Note that for any `log_transform` with `0 <= ||log_rotation|| < 2pi`
    (i.e. the rotation angle is between 0 and 2pi), the following identity holds:
    ```
    se3_log_map(se3_exponential_map(log_transform)) == log_transform
    ```

    The conversion has a singularity around `||log(transform)|| = 0`
    which is handled by clamping controlled with the `eps` argument.

    Args:
        log_transform: Batch of vectors of shape `(minibatch, 6)`.
        eps: A threshold for clipping the squared norm of the rotation logarithm
            to avoid unstable gradients in the singular case.

    Returns:
        Batch of transformation matrices of shape `(minibatch, 4, 4)`.

    Raises:
        ValueError if `log_transform` is of incorrect shape.
