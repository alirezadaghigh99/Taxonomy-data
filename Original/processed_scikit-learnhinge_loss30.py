def hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, *, labels=None, sample_weight=None):
    """Average hinge loss (non-regularized).

    In binary class case, assuming labels in y_true are encoded with +1 and -1,
    when a prediction mistake is made, ``margin = y_true * pred_decision`` is
    always negative (since the signs disagree), implying ``1 - margin`` is
    always greater than 1.  The cumulated hinge loss is therefore an upper
    bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    In multiclass case, the function expects that either all the labels are
    included in y_true or an optional labels argument is provided which
    contains all the labels. The multilabel margin is calculated according
    to Crammer-Singer's method. As in the binary case, the cumulated hinge loss
    is an upper bound of the number of mistakes made by the classifier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        True target, consisting of integers of two values. The positive label
        must be greater than the negative label.

    pred_decision : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_classes)
        Predicted decisions, as output by decision_function (floats).

    labels : array-like, default=None
        Contains all the labels for the problem. Used in multiclass hinge loss.

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float
        Average hinge loss.

    >>> from sklearn import svm

    >>> est = svm.LinearSVC(random_state=0)

    >>> hinge_loss([-1, 1, 1], pred_decision)

    >>> labels = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> est = svm.LinearSVC()
    >>> est.fit(X, Y)
    LinearSVC()
    >>> pred_decision = est.decision_function([[-1], [2], [3]])
    >>> y_true = [0, 2, 3]
    >>> hinge_loss(y_true, pred_decision, labels=labels)
