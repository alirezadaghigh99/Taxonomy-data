    """Compute the ``n_neighbors`` nearest points for each data point in ``X``
    under ``metric``. This may be exact, but more likely is approximated via
    nearest neighbor descent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The input data to compute the k-neighbor graph of.

    n_neighbors: int
        The number of nearest neighbors to compute for each sample in ``X``.

    metric: string or callable
        The metric to use for the computation.

    metric_kwds: dict
        Any arguments to pass to the metric computation function.

    angular: bool
        Whether to use angular rp trees in NN approximation.

    random_state: np.random state
        The random state to use for approximate NN computations.

    low_memory: bool (optional, default True)
        Whether to pursue lower memory NNdescent.

    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to print status data during the computation.

    Returns
    -------
    knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)
        The indices on the ``n_neighbors`` closest points in the dataset.

    knn_dists: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)
        The distances to the ``n_neighbors`` closest points in the dataset.

    rp_forest: list of trees
        The random projection forest used for searching (if used, None otherwise).
