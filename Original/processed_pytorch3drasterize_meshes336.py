    """
    Rasterize a batch of meshes given the shape of the desired output image.
    Each mesh is rasterized onto a separate image of shape
    (H, W) if `image_size` is a tuple or (image_size, image_size) if it
    is an int.

    If the desired image size is non square (i.e. a tuple of (H, W) where H != W)
    the aspect ratio needs special consideration. There are two aspect ratios
    to be aware of:
        - the aspect ratio of each pixel
        - the aspect ratio of the output image
    The camera can be used to set the pixel aspect ratio. In the rasterizer,
    we assume square pixels, but variable image aspect ratio (i.e rectangle images).

    In most cases you will want to set the camera aspect ratio to
    1.0 (i.e. square pixels) and only vary the
    `image_size` (i.e. the output image dimensions in pixels).

    Args:
        meshes: A Meshes object representing a batch of meshes, batch size N.
        image_size: Size in pixels of the output image to be rasterized.
            Can optionally be a tuple of (H, W) in the case of non square images.
        blur_radius: Float distance in the range [0, 2] used to expand the face
            bounding boxes for rasterization. Setting blur radius
            results in blurred edges around the shape instead of a
            hard boundary. Set to 0 for no blur.
        faces_per_pixel (Optional): Number of faces to save per pixel, returning
            the nearest faces_per_pixel points along the z-axis.
        bin_size: Size of bins to use for coarse-to-fine rasterization. Setting
            bin_size=0 uses naive rasterization; setting bin_size=None attempts to
            set it heuristically based on the shape of the input. This should not
            affect the output, but can affect the speed of the forward pass.
        max_faces_per_bin: Only applicable when using coarse-to-fine rasterization
            (bin_size > 0); this is the maximum number of faces allowed within each
            bin. This should not affect the output values, but can affect
            the memory usage in the forward pass.
        perspective_correct: Bool, Whether to apply perspective correction when computing
            barycentric coordinates for pixels. This should be set to True if a perspective
            camera is used.
        clip_barycentric_coords: Whether, after any perspective correction is applied
            but before the depth is calculated (e.g. for z clipping),
            to "correct" a location outside the face (i.e. with a negative
            barycentric coordinate) to a position on the edge of the face.
        cull_backfaces: Bool, Whether to only rasterize mesh faces which are
            visible to the camera.  This assumes that vertices of
            front-facing triangles are ordered in an anti-clockwise
            fashion, and triangles that face away from the camera are
            in a clockwise order relative to the current view
            direction. NOTE: This will only work if the mesh faces are
            consistently defined with counter-clockwise ordering when
            viewed from the outside.
        z_clip_value: if not None, then triangles will be clipped (and possibly
            subdivided into smaller triangles) such that z >= z_clip_value.
            This avoids camera projections that go to infinity as z->0.
            Default is None as clipping affects rasterization speed and
            should only be turned on if explicitly needed.
            See clip.py for all the extra computation that is required.
        cull_to_frustum: if True, triangles outside the view frustum will be culled.
            Culling involves removing all faces which fall outside view frustum.
            Default is False so that it is turned on only when needed.

    Returns:
        4-element tuple containing

        - **pix_to_face**: LongTensor of shape
          (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
          giving the indices of the nearest faces at each pixel,
          sorted in ascending z-order.
          Concretely ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` means that
          ``faces_verts[f]`` is the kth closest face (in the z-direction)
          to pixel (y, x). Pixels that are hit by fewer than
          faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
        - **zbuf**: FloatTensor of shape (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
          giving the NDC z-coordinates of the nearest faces at each pixel,
          sorted in ascending z-order.
          Concretely, if ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then
          ``zbuf[n, y, x, k] = face_verts[f, 2]``. Pixels hit by fewer than
          faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
        - **barycentric**: FloatTensor of shape
          (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel, 3)
          giving the barycentric coordinates in NDC units of the
          nearest faces at each pixel, sorted in ascending z-order.
          Concretely, if ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then
          ``[w0, w1, w2] = barycentric[n, y, x, k]`` gives
          the barycentric coords for pixel (y, x) relative to the face
          defined by ``face_verts[f]``. Pixels hit by fewer than
          faces_per_pixel are padded with -1.
        - **pix_dists**: FloatTensor of shape
          (N, image_size, image_size, faces_per_pixel)
          giving the signed Euclidean distance (in NDC units) in the
          x/y plane of each point closest to the pixel. Concretely if
          ``pix_to_face[n, y, x, k] = f`` then ``pix_dists[n, y, x, k]`` is the
          squared distance between the pixel (y, x) and the face given
          by vertices ``face_verts[f]``. Pixels hit with fewer than
          ``faces_per_pixel`` are padded with -1.

        In the case that image_size is a tuple of (H, W) then the outputs
        will be of shape `(N, H, W, ...)`.
