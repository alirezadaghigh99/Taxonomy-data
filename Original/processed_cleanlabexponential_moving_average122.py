    r"""Exponential moving average (EMA) score aggregation function.

    For a score vector s = (s_1, ..., s_K) with K scores, the values
    are sorted in *descending* order and the exponential moving average
    of the last score is calculated, denoted as EMA_K according to the
    note below.

    Note
    ----

    The recursive formula for the EMA at step :math:`t = 2, ..., K` is:

    .. math::

        \text{EMA}_t = \alpha \cdot s_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{EMA}_{t-1}, \qquad 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1

    We set :math:`\text{EMA}_1 = s_1` as the largest score in the sorted vector s.

    :math:`\alpha` is the "forgetting factor" that gives more weight to the
    most recent scores, and successively less weight to the previous scores.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s :
        Scores to be transformed.

    alpha :
        Discount factor that determines the weight of the previous EMA score.
        Higher alpha means that the previous EMA score has a lower weight while
        the current score has a higher weight.

        Its value must be in the interval [0, 1].

        If alpha is None, it is set to 2 / (K + 1) where K is the number of scores.

    axis :
        Axis along which the scores are sorted.

    Returns
    -------
    s_ema :
        Exponential moving average score.

    >>> s = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]])
