    r"""Resize the input image to the given size.
    If the image is torch Tensor, it is expected
    to have [..., H, W] shape, where ... means an arbitrary number of leading dimensions

    Args:
        img (PIL Image or Tensor): Image to be resized.
        size (sequence or int): Desired output size. If size is a sequence like
            (h, w), the output size will be matched to this. If size is an int,
            the smaller edge of the image will be matched to this number maintaining
            the aspect ratio. i.e, if height > width, then image will be rescaled to
            :math:`\left(\text{size} \times \frac{\text{height}}{\text{width}}, \text{size}\right)`.

            .. note::
                In torchscript mode size as single int is not supported, use a sequence of length 1: ``[size, ]``.
        interpolation (InterpolationMode): Desired interpolation enum defined by
            :class:`torchvision.transforms.InterpolationMode`.
            Default is ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR``. If input is Tensor, only ``InterpolationMode.NEAREST``,
            ``InterpolationMode.NEAREST_EXACT``, ``InterpolationMode.BILINEAR`` and ``InterpolationMode.BICUBIC`` are
            supported.
            The corresponding Pillow integer constants, e.g. ``PIL.Image.BILINEAR`` are accepted as well.
        max_size (int, optional): The maximum allowed for the longer edge of
            the resized image. If the longer edge of the image is greater
            than ``max_size`` after being resized according to ``size``,
            ``size`` will be overruled so that the longer edge is equal to
            ``max_size``.
            As a result, the smaller edge may be shorter than ``size``. This
            is only supported if ``size`` is an int (or a sequence of length
            1 in torchscript mode).
        antialias (bool, optional): Whether to apply antialiasing.
            It only affects **tensors** with bilinear or bicubic modes and it is
            ignored otherwise: on PIL images, antialiasing is always applied on
            bilinear or bicubic modes; on other modes (for PIL images and
            tensors), antialiasing makes no sense and this parameter is ignored.
            Possible values are:

            - ``True`` (default): will apply antialiasing for bilinear or bicubic modes.
              Other mode aren't affected. This is probably what you want to use.
            - ``False``: will not apply antialiasing for tensors on any mode. PIL
              images are still antialiased on bilinear or bicubic modes, because
              PIL doesn't support no antialias.
            - ``None``: equivalent to ``False`` for tensors and ``True`` for
              PIL images. This value exists for legacy reasons and you probably
              don't want to use it unless you really know what you are doing.

            The default value changed from ``None`` to ``True`` in
            v0.17, for the PIL and Tensor backends to be consistent.

    Returns:
        PIL Image or Tensor: Resized image.
