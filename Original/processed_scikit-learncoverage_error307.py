def coverage_error(y_true, y_score, *, sample_weight=None):
    """Coverage error measure.

    Compute how far we need to go through the ranked scores to cover all
    true labels. The best value is equal to the average number
    of labels in ``y_true`` per sample.

    Ties in ``y_scores`` are broken by giving maximal rank that would have
    been assigned to all tied values.

    Note: Our implementation's score is 1 greater than the one given in
    Tsoumakas et al., 2010. This extends it to handle the degenerate case
    in which an instance has 0 true labels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
        True binary labels in binary indicator format.

    y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions
        (as returned by "decision_function" on some classifiers).

    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.

    Returns
    -------
    coverage_error : float
        The coverage error.
