def _grid_from_X(X, percentiles, is_categorical, grid_resolution):
    """Generate a grid of points based on the percentiles of X.

    The grid is a cartesian product between the columns of ``values``. The
    ith column of ``values`` consists in ``grid_resolution`` equally-spaced
    points between the percentiles of the jth column of X.

    If ``grid_resolution`` is bigger than the number of unique values in the
    j-th column of X or if the feature is a categorical feature (by inspecting
    `is_categorical`) , then those unique values will be used instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_target_features)
        The data.

    percentiles : tuple of float
        The percentiles which are used to construct the extreme values of
        the grid. Must be in [0, 1].

    is_categorical : list of bool
        For each feature, tells whether it is categorical or not. If a feature
        is categorical, then the values used will be the unique ones
        (i.e. categories) instead of the percentiles.

    grid_resolution : int
        The number of equally spaced points to be placed on the grid for each
        feature.

    Returns
    -------
    grid : ndarray of shape (n_points, n_target_features)
        A value for each feature at each point in the grid. ``n_points`` is
        always ``<= grid_resolution ** X.shape[1]``.

    values : list of 1d ndarrays
        The values with which the grid has been created. The size of each
        array ``values[j]`` is either ``grid_resolution``, or the number of
        unique values in ``X[:, j]``, whichever is smaller.
