    Generate the modified tapes and coefficients required to compute the pulse generator
    derivative of a tape with respect to an indicated trainable parameter.

        tape (QuantumTape): The quantum tape to differentiate.

        atol (float): The absolute tolerance.

        tuple: A tuple containing the start and end indices into the total list of tapes as well as the coefficients needed for contraction.
